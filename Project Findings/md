# Findings — Supplier Performance & Lead-Time Analysis (Northwind SQL Project)

## Objective
Evaluate supplier performance in the Northwind PostgreSQL database by measuring the **average lead time** (required_date – order_date) by supplier.  
The goal is to identify which suppliers pose the greatest risk of delayed fulfillment and where improvement opportunities exist.

## Key Results

| Supplier | Avg Lead Time (Days) | Performance |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Tokyo Traders** | **26.35** |  Best performance |
| **PB Knäckebröd AB** | **28.82** |  Slowest performance |

---

## Insights

### 1️. Lead times are consistently long across all suppliers
- The difference between the best and worst supplier performance is only ~2.5 days.
- This indicates **system-level delays**, not an isolated problem with a single vendor.

### 2️. Supplier behavior still affects operational risk
- Tokyo Traders is the **fastest** and offers the **lowest fulfillment risk**.
- PB Knäckebröd AB has the **slowest** average lead time and creates the **highest risk of delay**.

### 3️. Improvement strategy should be broad rather than vendor-specific
Because all suppliers are slow, replacing or punishing a single vendor would not resolve the underlying issue.  
Improvement should focus on:

- Shipment coordination
- Production planning
- Supplier communication cycle
- Delivery-time expectations in contracts

Note: The northwind dataset is fictitious. Hence, the values for the required_date and order_date are probably randomly generated. This is probably the reason why all of the lead times are so similar. Everything contained in this project is for illustrative purposes only. 

### 4. KPIs can be used to drive improvement
A simple tiering system (Excellent / Acceptable / Needs Improvement) makes lead-time performance measurable and easy to communicate to leadership.

## Recommended Actions (Business Proposal Perspective)
- Introduce a **lead-time KPI** for all suppliers and monitor it monthly.
- Share **forecast expectations** with vendors to improve planning on both sides.
- Consider **incentives or penalties** tied to delivery-time performance.
- Use SQL analysis on a quarterly basis to confirm whether lead time improves over time.

## Technical Summary
- **Database:** PostgreSQL — Northwind sample database
- **Tables used:** suppliers, products, order_details, orders
- **SQL concepts demonstrated:**  
  `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, calculated fields (date difference), and `CASE` for performance ratings

## Status
Project complete and actively maintained for portfolio use.
